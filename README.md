# climate-and-seasonality

An exploration of the change in temperature in Sydney over time, taking into account seasonality, using weather station data.

Then the CO<sub>2</sub> recorded at Mauna Loa was added, as it is an isolated region on the planet that isn't subject to local fluctuation in readings caused by human development. From both the temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> readings, we can see what appears to be a relation between the two readings. Correlation does not equal causation, although the link between the two points strongly to the fact that the relationship is worrying and is rightly of concern to our modern society.

Analysis performed using pandas, and exported to Tableau in CSV format for visualisation.
